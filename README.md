## Terraform Modules Examples

This repository contains a collection of example Terraform modules to help you understand and implement infrastructure as code using Terraform.

## What is Terraform?

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool created by HashiCorp. It allows you to define and manage your infrastructure using a declarative language, enabling you to version, share, and reuse your infrastructure configurations.## Installation

1. Choose the appropriate package for your operating system
2. Download and extract the package
3. Add the Terraform binary to your system's PATH

For detailed installation instructions, refer to the official Terraform documentation.
